# World-Hub
This is a website for different worlds I've created. Right now you're mostly going to find documentation for Asha, which is the setting for a Pathfinder 2e campaign I'm running. In the future though, I'll be adding much more to see.

I recently deployed it using free azure hosting here: https://worldhub.azurewebsites.net/

## ASP.NET Swap
A long time ago I had a website that was running solely for the Asha setting, so a big part of getting this website up and running has been transferring over the old website. Since I was originally using PHP for that website and my skills as a programmer have naturally grown since then, this initially left me with a lot of old problems to fix.

I believe these problems are mostly fixed and as someone who enjoys C#, I'm enjoying ASP.NET a lot.
