# World-Hub
This is a website for different worlds I've created. Right now you're mostly going to find documentation for Asha, which is the setting for a Pathfinder 2e campaign I'm running. In the future though, I'll be adding much more to see.

I recently deployed it using free azure hosting here: https://worldhub.azurewebsites.net/. This is bound to be a bit behind the GitHub repo.

## ASP.NET Swap
A long time ago I had a website that was running solely for the Asha setting and in D&D 5e instead of Pathfinder 2e. So a big part of getting this website up and running has been transferring over the old website and re-working the documentation. Since I was originally using PHP for that website and my skills as a programmer have naturally grown since then, this initially left me with a lot of old problems to fix.

These problems have all been fixed and as someone who enjoys C#, I'm enjoying working with ASP.NET a lot.

## Readability and Accessibility
Since the primary goal of this website is to provide documentation for my players, I consider readability and accessibility to be what matters most. I am currently working on making the website easier to navigate, but I'd say my goal after that is to make it mobile friendly. After that I'll tackle accessibility issues as I'm made aware of them. 

## Long-term Goals
While this website is currently just documentation for my players, I do have some longer term goals for the website:

- [ ] User logins with assigned roles. I believe this would need to be tied to a SQL database.
- [ ] Web applications, such as character builders. This would come after the database so that people can save their work.

Overall, these are very much "long term goals" that probably won't be implemented soon. Part of that is simply because adding a database will likely mean I can no longer host the website for free on azure, but this stuff is certainly on my radar.
